# Housing Price Prediction with PyTorch

This project uses a simple linear regression model implemented in PyTorch to predict housing prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. The model learns to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`) using various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Boston Housing dataset.
- **Model**: A linear regression model built using PyTorch.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
